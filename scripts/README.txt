This is the directory for old junk - mostly unmaintained
runoff and miscellaneous scripts from the original xv6.

They are not guaranteed to work, and many of them have lost
their purpose outside of playing around with them. They are kept
here for historical and reference purposes.

If you have seen one that's actually useful, feel free to contribute!
You could put it into the tools/ directory and fix it if not working.
